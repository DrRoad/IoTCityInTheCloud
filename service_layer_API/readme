On the flask application there are the configurations for the microservice:

POSTGRES_USER - database username
POSTGRES_PW - database password
POSTGRES_DB - database name
POSTGRES_URL - url to fetch data from the database
DB_URL - final url to connection


Other notes:
- The postgresSQL database will be launched and will be configured by the flask app before the first request
- All the requirements should install themselfs automatically on the first run

###
It is possible to expose some functions that are implemented internally like:
- Create/delete roles
- Create/delete actions
- Create/delete permissions
